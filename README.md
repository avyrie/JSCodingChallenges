# Coding Challenges - JavaScript

* Pro-tip: add the VSCode extension, Quokka.js - this will update the result of your code in real time so you don't have to keep running it in the console
- To use: add the extension, while in file on Mac type cmd + shift + P, select "Quokka.js: Start on Current File"

This repo contains multiple files each containing a unique JavaScript coding challenge. I will update this repo with more challenges and ways to solve. If you think of another way to solve a challenge, please message or send a merge request.

## Challenges List:
- arrayOfNonRepeatingNumbersInRandomOrder.js - Create an array of random numbers that do not repeat and are NOT in consecutive order
