# Coding Challenges - JavaScript

* Pro-tip: add the VSCode extension, Quokka.js - this will update the result of your code in real time so you don't have to keep running it in the console
- To use: add the extension, while in file on Mac type cmd + shift + P, select "Quokka.js: Start on Current File"

This repo contains multiple files each containing a unique JavaScript coding challenge. I will update this repo with more challenges and ways to solve. If you think of another way to solve a challenge, please message or send a merge request.

## Challenges List:

- arrOfArr.js - Given a positive integer n, create an array that is n length where each item is an array with just the index of that particular array in it.
- arrOfNonRepNumsInRandOrder.js - Create an array of random numbers that do not repeat and are ordered randomly.
- arrOfProds.js - Write a function that takes in a given non-empty array and returns an array containing the product of every other number in the given array
- arrWInArr.js - Write a function that returns true if all items in an array exist within another array and false if not 
- atLeastFive.js - Create a function that prints all numbers up to and including a given argument. No matter tha argument, the function should print each number up to and including 5.
- atMostFive.js - Create a function that prints all numbers starting at 1 up to and including a given argument. If the given argument is greater than 5, only print up to and including 5.
- bus.js - Given an array of arrays representing each stop in a bus route, calculate the number of people on the bus when it gets to the end of its route
- checkEvenness.js - Write a function that returns the "odd number out" in an array (ex. array would be all even numbers except for one odd number or vice versa)
- checkEvennessPos.js - Write a function that returns the POSITION of the "odd number out" in an array (ex. array would be all even numbers except for one odd number or vice versa)
- doubleArr.js - Given an array of integers, return a new array with each value doubled. Use the map method.
- descendingOrder.js - Return an array that is sorted from the longest word to the shortest.
- featuredProduct.js - Write a function that returns the most popular product sold at a store. 
- findNum.js - Find if a given element is present in a given array or not.
- firstCapital.js - Given a string, return the string with the first letter of each word capitalized
- indicesOfNumsAddToTar.js - Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
- monotonic.js - Write a function that returns true if the given array is monotonic and false if not.
- oddNumOut.js - Given an array, write a function that returns the value int he array that does not match the others
- oddNums.js - Return all the odd numbers between two given integers.
- palindromes.js - Check to see if a given string is a palindrome or not
- removeDuplicated.js - Write a function that removes duplicate values from an array
- removeDuplicates.js - Given two arrays of numbers, return an array containing only the numbers that are present in array a that are not present in array b
- revStr.js - Write a function that takes in a string and outputs that same string, but reversed.
- slice.js - Write a function to test if shifting the characters in one string will equal a second string
- smallestDiff.js - Write a function that takes in two non-empty arrays of integers, finds the pair of numbers (one from each array) whose absolute difference is closest to zero, and returns an array containing those two numbers with the number from the first array in the first position.
- sockPairs.js - Given an array of integers representing the color of each sock in a pile, determine how many pairs of socks with matching colors there are.
- spiralMatrices.js - Write a function that takes in an n x m array and returns a one-dimensional array of all the array's elements in spiral order.
- stringsAndNums.js - Sort an array with both strings and numbers so that the strings come first and the numbers come after. The strings should be sorted in reverse order and the numbers should be in ascending order
- subsequence.js - Given two non-empty arrays of inteers, write a functionn that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first array.
- toEnd.js - Write a function that takes in a given array of integers and a target number and returns the array with all instances of the target number now moved to the end of the array.
- twoSum.js - Given an array of integers target number, return 2 numbers in the array that add up to the target number.
- uniqueString.js - Given two strings containing only letters a-z, return the longest possible string containing distinct, non-repeating letters from both strings
- validEmail.js - Write a function to test if an e-mail address is in a valid format (XXX@XXX.xxx)
- validPhoneNumber.js - Write a function that checks to see if a given phone number is valid
- valleyCount.js - Given a string representing a hike (U = up, D = down) return the number of valleys this string portrays.
- walk.js - Given an array of strings representing a walk where each item represents a block that takes 1 minute to walk each (n = North, s = South, e = East, w = West), return true if the man will end up back at his original location in 10 minutes and false if not
