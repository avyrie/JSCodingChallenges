# Coding Challenges - JavaScript

* Pro-tip: add the VSCode extension, Quokka.js - this will update the result of your code in real time so you don't have to keep running it in the console
- To use: add the extension, while in file on Mac type cmd + shift + P, select "Quokka.js: Start on Current File"

This repo contains multiple files each containing a unique JavaScript coding challenge. I will update this repo with more challenges and ways to solve. If you think of another way to solve a challenge, please message or send a merge request.

## Challenges List:
- arrOfNonRepNumsInRandOrder.js - Create an array of random numbers that do not repeat and are ordered randomly.
- arrOfProds.js - Write a function that takes in a given non-empty array and returns an array containing the product of every other number in the given array
- arrWInArr.js - Write a function that returns true if all items in an array exist within another array and false if not 
- atLeastFive.js - Create a function that prints all numbers up to and including a given argument. No matter tha argument, the function should print each number up to and including 5.
- atMostFive.js - Create a function that prints all numbers starting at 1 up to and including a given argument. If the given argument is greater than 5, only print up to and including 5.
- findNum.js - Find if a given element is present in a given array or not.
- indicesOfNumsAddToTar.js - Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
- oddNums.js - Return all the odd numbers between two given integers.
- palindromes.js - Check to see if a given string is a palindrome or not
- revStr.js - Write a function that takes in a string and outputs that same string, but reversed.
- smallestDiff.js - Write a function that takes in two non-empty arrays of integers, finds the pair of numbers (one from each array) whose absolute difference is closest to zero, and returns an array containing those two numbers with the number from the first array in the first position.
- sockPairs.js - Given an array of integers representing the color of each sock in a pile, determine how many pairs of socks with matching colors there are.
- subsequence.js - Given two non-empty arrays of inteers, write a functionn that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first array.
- twoSum.js - Given an array of integers target number, return 2 numbers in the array that add up to the target number.
- valleyCount.js - Given a string representing a hike (U = up, D = down) return the number of valleys this string portrays.
